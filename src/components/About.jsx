            Hi there! I’m Miguel de Leon, a full-stack Web Developer with a
            passion for Front-end and Design. I enrolled at Uplift Code Camp, a
            coding bootcamp based in the Philippines, and graduated but I am
            currently living in Italy. I aspire toward a career that will allow
            me to challenge myself through learning new technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I’m not developing websites I enjoy biking, working out,
            playing the guitar, bass, or the drums.
