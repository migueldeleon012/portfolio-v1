            Hi there! I’m Miguel de Leon, a full-stack Web Developer with a
            passion for Front-end and Design. I’m currently attending an online
            coding bootcamp, and will graduate soon at Uplift Code Camp based in
            the Philippines, but I am currently living in Italy. I aspire toward
            a career that will allow me to challenge myself through learning new
            technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I’m not developing websites I enjoy biking, working out,
            playing the guitar, bass, or the drums.
